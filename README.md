# RISC-V-INTERNSHIP
RISC-V RTL DESIGN USING VERILOG PROJECT
This project was based on designing a RISC-V RV-32I core using Verilog. During the course of the project we learned to design basic hardware modules of the core like the decoder unit, immediate generator, load unit, store unit, branch unit, ALU etc. Intel Quartus Prime was used to verify the modules using testbenches.
